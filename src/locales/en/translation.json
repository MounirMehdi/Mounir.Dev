Platforms like Next.js, Gatsby and Nuxt.js allow creating complex applications with near-instant loading times.</p><h3>WebAssembly changes the game</h3><p>With WebAssembly, it is now possible to execute compiled code (C++, Rust) in the browser, opening the door to web applications with near-native performance.</p><h3>AI integrated into development</h3><p>Tools like GitHub Copilot and Amazon CodeWhisperer are transforming the development experience, suggesting code in real time and automating repetitive tasks.</p>"
